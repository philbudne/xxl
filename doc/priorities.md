# Priorities (loosely ordered):

* simplicity / ease of understanding

* minimal: avoid clutter in the core

	the less carved into stone, the better.
	methods >> functions >> syntax

* correctness:
	everything should work

* uniformity/generality:

	minimum of magic or crockery (special cases)
	Principle of Least Astonishment

* extensible

* expressive power
	primatives chosen for usefulness in creating language features

* "high albedo" (reflectivity)

	minimum of hidden machinery
	(entirety of class system is visible from programs;
	 VM code & scopes *currently* less so)

* performance: avoid premature optimization

* modularity

* ease of use / useful diagnostics
	this is not a language for beginners

* safety
	this is not a language for beginners
