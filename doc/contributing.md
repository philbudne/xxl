* Since the language is intentionally plastic, divergence
  may be inevitable, but it would be better to have cooperation.

* See:
  * [language influences](influences.md)
  * [discussion of design priorities](prioriries.md)
  * [formatting/style guide](style.md)

* Overall: be kind and decent.

	I have not read enough codes of conduct in their entirety
	to have any opinions on what to choose.

*  Remember humans with feelings will perceive the light
   patterns that are the result of your typing.  Please consider that:

  * Asking a question such as "I can't help wondering why.....", will
    DEFINITELY make your missive a less bitter pill to swallow than
    ".... is wrong", even if you're convinced I'm an idiot.

  * I'm not a genius (and no longer wish I was one), and while I've
    joked I have flypaper between my ears for my ability to remember
    random minutiae, I likely don't have a ready answer to EVERY question.
    But there are DEFINITELY places where I was lost in the fog,
    and battered my way out (hopefully leaving a comment).

  * Working code is a better demonstration of an idea than hand waving.
    (it's possible your idea was considered and rejected for some reason,
    or previously implemented and removed)

  * Just because it works doesn't mean it's good/right.
    Always be prepared to throw away an implementation
    (like the first waffle).

  * Comments containing "XXX" have been left where there's something
    that may not be quite right.  *BUT* not every one is something that
    needs to be fixed, at least not without some investigation and
    discussion.  If this becomes a "project" then using github issue
    tracking (and dropping refs to the issue numbers in the code)
    
  * More than three X's are an indication of greater concern.

  * TEMP is an indication that this is a place where the solution
    is hoped/anticipated to be temporary.
