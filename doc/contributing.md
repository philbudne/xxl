  Especially since, with an intentionally plastic language,
  incompatible variants are likely inevtiable (due to differences in
  opinion and taste).

  The author has some strong opinions, but may not be cut out (or
  desire) to be a "benevolent dictator for life"

  Overall: be kind and decent.

  Remember humans with feelings will perceive the light
  patterns that are the result of your typing.  Please consider that:

  * Asking a question such as "I can't help wondering why.....", will
    DEFINITELY make your missive a less bitter pill to swallow than
    ".... is wrong", even if you're convinced I'm an idiot.

  * I'm not a genius (and no longer wish I was one), and while I've
    joked I have flypaper between my ears for my ability to remember
    minutiae, I likely don't have a ready answer to EVERY question.
    But there are DEFINITELY places where I was lost in the fog,
    and battered my way out (hopefully leaving a comment).

  * Working code is a better demonstration of an idea than hand waving.
    (it's possible your idea was considered and rejected for some reason,
    or previously implemented and removed)

  * Just because it works doesn't mean it's good/right.
    Always be prepared to throw away an implementation
    (like the first waffle).

  * Comments containing "XXX" have been left where there's something
    that may not be quite right.  *BUT* not every one is something that
    needs to be fixed, at least not without some investigation and
    discussion.  If this becomes a "project" then using github issue
    tracking (and dropping refs to the issue numbers in the code)
    
    More than three X's are an indication of greater concern.

    TEMP is an indication that this is a place where the solution
    is hoped/anticipated to be temporary.
