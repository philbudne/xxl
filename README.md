# eXtensible eXperimenal Language version Zero (XXL/0) [(*)](#intended-jokes)

A self-hosting extensible language, VM/type system in Python3.

*WARNING* the code and laguage are HIGHLY fluid!

Please consider this a toy!!

## Overall:

* A sandbox for testing out ideas for "little languages"

* The base language contains enough to write the compiler;
	(the compiler gives itself good coverage).

* Has a test suite of simple programs for when something breaks

* [Priorities](doc/priorities.md) -- a loose ordering of design priorities

* [Influences](doc/influences.md) -- language influences

* [Contributing](doc/contributing.md) -- please read this before creating a bug report, or a pull request

* [Syntax and Style](doc/syntax.md) -- language syntax and style

* [Bootstrapping](doc/bootstrapping.md) -- reminder on bootstrapping features

* [Prehistory](doc/prehistory.md) -- early influences and pre-github history

### Intended jokes

* PL/1 was IBM's "One Language to Rule Them All" for System/360
     (the one computer architecture anyone would ever need).
     PL/1 was meant to replace both FORTRAN for scientific code
     and COBOL for business applications; it was a large
     language which had no reserved words, and all numeric
     variables were declared with their precision.

* Intended to be the smallest possible core language,
  one that no one "needs"

* XXL is the U.S. clothing size two sizes larger than "large"
