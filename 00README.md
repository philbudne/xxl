eXtensible eXperimenal Language version Zero (XXL/0) (*)

A self-hosting extensible language, written in Python3.

*WARNING* the code and laguage are HIGHLY fluid!

Please consider this a toy!!

Overall:

A sandbox for testing out ideas for "little languages"

PRIMARILY came at this as a language/compiler person.

The base language contains enough to write the compiler.
(the compiler gives itself good coverage)

Has a test suite of simple programs for when something breaks

(*) Intended jokes:

* PL/1 was IBM's "One Language to Rule Them All" for System/360
     (the one computer architecture anyone would ever need).
     PL/1 was meant to replace both FORTRAN for scientific code
     and COBOL for business applications; it was a large
     language which had no reserved words, and all numeric
     variables were declared with their precision.

* Intended to be the smallest possible core language,
  one that no one "needs"

* XXL is the U.S. clothing size two sizes larger than "large"
